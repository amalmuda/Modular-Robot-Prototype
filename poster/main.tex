        \section{Intro}
        Write a couple of sentences about your prototype here.
        \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
            \item Enlist your goals from assignment 4.
        \end{itemize}
        
        Include the image from \textit{task 2} in the assignment. Additionally, include
        images from previous assignments that you see fit. You can choose whether you'd like to include 
        them in the \textit{extra column} or in the text.
        \section{Tools}
        Describe the tools used here. 

        Enlist most important components. E.g:
        \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
            \item Dynamixel AX12
            \item Pneumatic cylinders
            \item Arduino
        \end{itemize}

        Include a description on the software that is interesting. Like language, libraries used, algorithms etc. 
        
    % this determines where your columns will be separated
    \columnbreak

        \section{Conclusion}

        Write a paragraph about how far you came in achieving the goals.

        Write a paragraph on \textit{Future work}. What would improve the robot? What could you do differently?
