*By Abdullah Almudaffar*

## 1) Firmware/software for the robot/prototype

<!-- delete from here-->
All the software for getting your prototype to work, should be put into `./src`. 

If you use Python, set up a `requirement.txt` that includes all the necessary modules.

Setup instructions:
```
$ conda create --name <ENV_NAME> --file requirements.txt
$ conda activate <ENV_NAME>
```

Run instructions: 
```
$ python 
```

<!-- delete from here-->
**Deliverables:** Source code in `./src` and setup/run instructions in this README.

## 2) Images from testing the robot

[![Image of the prototype in action](./poster/images/2.png)](./poster/main.pdf)

[![GIF of the prototype in action](./poster/images/2.gif)](./poster/main.pdf)

## 3) Poster

Create a poster based on the template in `./poster/`. 
There are some instructions in `./poster/README.md` in how to use the poster template.

Make a QR code that links to this github repo. See tip in `./poster/README.md`

We will hang all the posters in the common area in ROBIN after the deadline.

**Deliverables:** A nicely formatted/camera ready poster as `./poster/main.pdf`. Include all `.tex`-files and images in `./poster/` and `./poster/images/` so the PDF is reproducable.

Read more on my poster about the robot [here](./poster/main.pdf). For information on
CAD files, go to [this repo](link to assignment 5).
