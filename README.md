# The MATS - Modular Actuated Transforming System
<!-- replace heading to name of prototype/robot -->
*By Abdullah Almudaffar*

## 1) Firmware/software for the robot/prototype

Set up the environment:
```
$ conda create --name mats_env --file requirements.txt
$ conda activate mats_env
```
After that's installed, make sure:
- U2D2 Power Hub Board is turned ON
- USB is connected to your computer to the right port

Then you can run your Python files from the src folder with examples:
```
python breakdance.py
python wake_up.py
python dance.py
```
