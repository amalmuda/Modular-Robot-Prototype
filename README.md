The MATS - Modular Actuated Transforming System
<!-- replace heading to name of prototype/robot -->
*By Abdullah Almudaffar*

## 1) Firmware/software for the robot/prototype

Set up the environment:
```
$ conda create --name mats_env --file requirements.txt
$ conda activate mats_env
```
After that's installed, make sure:
- U2D2 Power Hub Board is turned ON
- USB is connected to your computer to the right port

Then you can run your Python files from the src folder with example:
```
python breakdance.py
python wake_up.py
python dance.py
```

## 2) Images from testing the robot

[![Image of the prototype in action](./poster/images/2.png)](./poster/main.pdf)

[![GIF of the prototype in action](./poster/images/2.gif)](./poster/main.pdf)

## 3) Poster

Create a poster based on the template in `./poster/`. 
There are some instructions in `./poster/README.md` in how to use the poster template.

Make a QR code that links to this github repo. See tip in `./poster/README.md`

We will hang all the posters in the common area in ROBIN after the deadline.

**Deliverables:** A nicely formatted/camera ready poster as `./poster/main.pdf`. Include all `.tex`-files and images in `./poster/` and `./poster/images/` so the PDF is reproducable.
